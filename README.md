This directory contains three items: "LIN_205A_FinalProject_Code.ipynb", "anew.csv", and "debate_transcripts.zip". 

The first file is the commented code used for this project.

The second file is the csv file containing the "Affective Norms for English Words", which was used in the analysis for this paper. This csv file was originally downloaded from the following site: https://osf.io/y6g5b/wiki/anew/.

The third file is a directory which contains three additional directories within it: "Democrat", "Original", and "Republican". The "Original" folder contains transcripts from each of the debates, which were directly copied and pasted from the following site: https://www.debates.org/voter-education/debate-transcripts/. The "Democrat" and "Republican" folders represent the "Democrat Corpus" and "Republican Corpus", respectively (i.e., transcripts for each of the Democratic speakers and for each of the Republican speakers).
